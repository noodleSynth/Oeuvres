# Oeuvres

Whats an [Oeuvre?](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100246262#:~:text=The%20French%20word%20for%20a,writer's%20principal%20work%20or%20masterpiece.)

## Motivation
I need a way to keep track of the things I do. This project serves exactly that purpose.

To showcase and serve as documentation of my `Oeuvre`

## Whats in this repo?
The frontend for the project.
- The Vue frontend
- for now...

## How to run it?
Youll need the backend for it to render the markdown at all.
But if you're committed to seeing it try and churn:
- You will need to install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Clone the repo into your desired directory
- Navigate to it using your favorite terminal (bash?)
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm run serve`
- That should do it, the page should be visible on localhost
